Johanna completed her PhD in ecology and environmental biology at the
University of Alberta, Canada. She then took up a government scholarship to
study biodiversity science at the University of Tokyo for two years.

She enjoys the challenge of working at the interface of ecology and economic
issues, and seeking solutions to complex problems.   

Johanna also maintains her private consultancy, JPEC. 

“My PhD was part of a large-scale multidisciplinary study examining
experimental forest harvesting. We were looking for harvesting regimes that
were less environmentally damaging. Seeing the issues through a scientific lens
influenced my thinking a lot.” 

Johanna received her Bachelor of Science with Honours from the University of
Canterbury, focusing on ecology and Japanese. She was then awarded a
scholarship to enable her to study at the University of Tokyo. 

“In Japan, I worked with a multinational team in Siberia, aiming to identify
critical habitat for the migratory birds that breed there and migrate through
Russia and Asia. The contrast between the pristine breeding grounds and the
some of the incredibly degraded habitats the birds occupy on migration was
staggering.”
 
Since returning to New Zealand, Johanna has worked with industry on
environmental issues, particularly commercial fishing and marine protected
species. She has maintained a strong international focus and collaborated with
multilateral organisations such as [ACAP](http://www.acap.aq). 

Johanna started [JPEC Ltd](http://www.jpec.co.nz) in 2011 as an independent and
objective expert consultancy. 

“The issues I like working on are the ones perceived as too difficult or too
messy to tackle. I have enjoyed working with Dragonfly Science in the past and
appreciate their unique approach to tough quantitative problems. Our expertise
is complementary.”
