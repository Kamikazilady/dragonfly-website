Katrin has a PhD in Marine Science from University of Otago,
where she studied the biology and ecology of burrowing ghost shrimp.

She worked as a marine ecologist for NIWA, then won a Foundation for
Research, Science and Technology postdoctoral fellowship to study the
interactions between burrowing shrimps and sea grass, and their influence
on associated benthic communities.

On her return, Katrin was the scientific editor of New Zealand Journal of
Marine and Freshwater Research for the Royal Society for five years. She
remains actively involved in benthic research through her adjunct
lectureship at the University of Otago.
