Finlay has long experience as a database and software developer. He leads 
the technical direction of Dragonfly's work, with a strong focus on open source

statistical solutions operational. Automated approaches have the
potential to massively increase quality, 
reproducibility and productivity of analytical systems, 
bringing significant savings to our clients. 


Finlay researched four dimensional algebra and geometry for his PhD in 
mathematics at [SISSA](http://sissa.it), Italy. He completed post-docs at [CIMAT](http://www.cimat.mx/)  in Mexico

then worked in Wellington's IT industry before joining Dragonfly in 2008. 

> I think decision making should be supported with the best available 
information. Data collection can be an expensive
investment for any organisation, so getting the best information from that data
is essential. In the long run, robust anaysis will produce a better return on
investment. It's gratifying to see our work being used to inform key commercial and
government decisions.
