Katrin has a PhD in Marine Science from University of Otago, where she studied
the biology and ecology of burrowing ghost shrimp, commonly found in estuaries
around New Zealand. 

She worked as a marine ecologist for NIWA, then won a Foundation for Research,
Science and Technology postdoctoral fellowship, based at the US Environmental
Protection Agency in Oregon, to study the interactions between burrowing
shrimps and sea grass, and their influence on associated benthic communities.

“The shrimps and the sea grass have opposing roles in these marine environments
– one stirs up the sand and the other traps it. I was particularly interested
in how these key players in sedimentary environments influence each other and
associated biota.

“Oregon in the US is very like southern New Zealand. I compared three estuaries
there with sites in the South Island to see if the patterns found here applied
in a wider context.

Katrin was the scientific editor of New Zealand Journal of Marine and
Freshwater Research for the Royal Society for five years and is involved with
writing and editing reports and publications for Dragonfly Science. 

As an adjunct lecturer at the University of Otago, Katrin supervises students
and is currently involved in researching  deep-sea benthic communities on
Chatham Rise and in other parts of New Zealand. She is also a certified
scientific diver.

“I really love diving and have carried out extensive sampling work in
Fiordland, Otago and around Stewart Island, despite the cold water
temperatures. You learn a lot by just being in places, so I often spend time on
beaches or estuaries or underwater, just looking.”
