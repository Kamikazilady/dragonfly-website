Edward has a PhD from Cambridge University, where he studied theoretical
physics in the cosmology group led by Stephen Hawking.

Returning to New Zealand, Edward worked as an oceanographer at
[NIWA](http://www.niwa.co.nz) for 10 years, researching interactions between
the physical and biological environment, particularly how stirring by ocean
currents affects plankton. Two years at Datamine provided business experience
and gave him an appreciation of the value of statistical analysis in solving
applied problems.

Edward started Dragonfly Science in 2006 to provide a customised data
analysis service. [Read more](/people/abraham-edward.html)
