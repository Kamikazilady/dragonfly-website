Christopher has a passion for improving the collection, analysis and visualisation of data through database design, websites and applications. 

He sees visualisation as a useful addition to the data analysis toolkit that Dragonfly Science already offers.

“You can use visualisation to play with data and easily see ideas and patterns. To put that sort of flexibility in the hands of the public is exciting - they start to see that data can tell a story and relate it to their own life."

He recently developed an interactive application for the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. Based on the Regional Economic Activity Report, it allows users to find information on 66 sub-regional areas across New Zealand and encourages them to interact with the data at a greater level of detail. 

Christopher is also a specialist in dealing with data collected in the field and is currently working with the Paua Industry Council to improve how changes in the marine environment are detected.

It can take up to three years for fishery managers to become aware of changed in the productivity of a region. By recording the position of boats alongside the time spent underwater by divers, Dragonfly can determine whether or not an area is productive within a matter of hours. 

"If the divers spend too long looking for paua, there’s not enough there. We’re gathering enough data to make definite assertions when determining abundance, but need to eliminate factors such as the murkiness water and weather."

Christopher is also the co-founder of iDive and helped to develop the world’s first functional touchscreen housings for using iPads underwater.
