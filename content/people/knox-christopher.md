Christopher has a PhD in physical chemistry from the University of
Canterbury, where he studied photochemistry in small droplets of liquid.

Christopher gained a PhD in physical chemistry from the University of
Canterbury and completed two post-docs at the University of California Irvine.

Although he first dabbled in visualisation during his PhD, it was a chance
meeting with a group at Irvine that enabled him to enter the field. The group
were exploring large scale visualisation but were short of a physical
scientist.

“It was a great opportunity, so I stayed on and did a second post-doc. That led
me to a software engineering job with
[NVIDIA](http://www.nvidia.com/content/global/global.php) in Finland, where I
worked in their mobile business unit on software for the early Tegra chips.

Moving to Saudi Arabia, Christopher took up a position using visualisation to
support research scientists at the [King Abdullah University of Science and
Technology](http://www.kaust.edu.sa/). These included chemists who were enabled
to virtually stand inside the molecules they were studying, and biologists with
vast data sets who could view them all on a screen rather than taping sheets of
paper together.

Christopher sees visualisation as a useful addition to the data analysis
toolkit that Dragonfly Science already offers to clients.

“You can use visualisation to play with your data and come up with ideas and
patterns, and very quickly get rid of what you’re not interested in. To put
that sort of flexibility in the hands of your user is exciting - they’re not
stuck with what you thought was a nice view of the data.

“Of course then you have to check it will hold up under analysis, but to be
able to offer visualisation alongside rigorous analysis in the same company is
very powerful.”
