Philipp studied marine ecology at the [Université de la
Méditerranée](http://www.imbe.fr/?lang=fr) in France and obtained a Masters
in ecological modelling, quantifying the benefits of marine reserves to
local fisheries.

He moved to New Zealand in 2007 for a PhD at [Victoria
University](http://www.victoria.ac.nz/sbs/research-centres-institutes/vucel),
where he modelled the connectivity of fish populations in Cook Strait, near
Wellington.  Philipp then spent two years as a post-doc at [Rutgers
University](http://marine.rutgers.edu/~ojensen/) in the US, researching
patterns of decline and recovery in overfished populations around the
world.

He returned to New Zealand in 2013 to take up a position with Dragonfly
