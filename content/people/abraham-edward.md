Edward has a PhD from Cambridge University, where he studied theoretical
physics in the cosmology group led by Stephen Hawking.

Returning to New Zealand, Edward worked as an oceanographer at
[NIWA](http://www.niwa.co.nz) for 10 years, researching interactions between
the physical and biological environment, particularly how stirring by ocean
currents affects plankton. Two years at Datamine provided business experience
and gave him an appreciation of the value of statistical analysis in solving
applied problems.

Edward started Dragonfly Science in 2006 to provide a customised data analysis
service.

Edward's undergraduate study was at the University of Canterbury, where he
completed a Bachelor of Science with Honours in physics and maths, then gained
a Commonwealth Scholarship for his study at Cambridge.

“My PhD was the old-fashioned pencil and paper kind, generating pages and pages
filled with algebraic scribbling. I also learned that you could solve problems
simply by thinking about them.

“Stephen Hawking was an interesting character to work with, even though he
wasn't my direct supervisor. He would sneak up to you in his wheelchair and
talk with his synthesised voice. It was incredibly intimidating. I valued his
accessibility to students though, and the fact that he was always interested in
what we were doing.

“I started Dragonfly because I wanted to apply what I had learned at Datamine
about data analysis to scientific questions, particularly in biology. I also
saw an opportunity to provide this kind of applied research. There is
definitely a role for scientific research undertaken in a commercial
environment that's complementary to government-funded research in traditional
institutions.”

Edward is interested in the value that small businesses bring to the economy,
and enjoys the dynamic way that they can operate.

“I like being one of a bunch of similar sized companies, all doing their edgy
things very well. And being part of both the science and software communities
here in Wellington is exciting.”
