Christopher has a PhD in physical chemistry from the University of
Canterbury, where he studied photochemistry in small droplets of liquid.

He
then completed two post-docs at the University of California Irvine—the
first in atmospheric chemistry and the second as a visualisation scientist.

Subsequently, Christopher moved to Finland to work for
[NVIDIA](http://www.nvidia.com/content/global/global.php) as a software
engineer in their mobile graphics group and then to Saudi Arabia at [King
Abdullah University of Science and Technology](http://www.kaust.edu.sa/),
supporting research teams to visualise their large data sets.

Christopher’s experience using visualisation in a scientific context
complements Dragonfly’s expertise in statistical analysis and programming.
