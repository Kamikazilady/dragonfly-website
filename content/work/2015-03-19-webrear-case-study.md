We worked with the Ministry of Business, Innovation, & Employment to make data on New Zealand’s regional
economies widely available. We built a data-rich website and iPad app that allows a deep exploration of
these data.

The Regional Economic Activity Report presents data on a broad range of
economic activity in New Zealand. As part of the government’s Business Growth Agenda, 
Minister Steven Joyce 
wanted to make the report accessible to a wider audience by creating an 
online version.  Regional and city council staff had also requested access to more detailed 
information, 
to inform their policy and planning around resources, permitting, and business management.

We built an interactive desktop version of the report, which was
then released as an iPad and mobile app. A single source of data flows through to the report,
the website, and the apps, to ensure the integrity of the data across all the
presentations. We worked with digital design agency Salted Herring to create a look and feel that
matched the Ministry’s own styles. Charts and maps were drawn using the software R, and we used the EmberJS
web framework to create a responsive, dynamic website that could also be cost-effectively delivered as a
mobile app.

To successfully deliver the project, we worked with a large team of up to 30 people across MBIE and 
externally. We were able to coordinate this team and deliver the website, following an 
extremely tight timetable to meet 
the Minister’s release date.
