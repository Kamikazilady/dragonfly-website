## The problem

Pāua are best managed at a fine, reef scale. Overfishing has serious long 
term impacts and some areas never recover. Existing stock assessment 
surveys were not giving pāua fishers enough information to manage their 
resource effectively. 

PIC has developed dataloggers (which attach to a diver’s wetsuit) to record 
the position of each dive. The daily catch from each diver is also recorded. 
We were asked to devise a simple interface to upload the catch and location 
data, check and analyse it, then present the information graphically for the 
fishers. This would provide them with almost real-time feedback on the 
productivity of each pāua reef. 

## The solution

We built a web-based system to automatically transfer each day’s catch data 
to a database and visualise it graphically and on a map. Catch volumes in 
different locations can be displayed as coloured hexagons – green for a great 
catch and red for a not-so-good one. 
The datalogger system is improving catch rates across the fishery – a sign of 
a healthy and sustainably managed resource. Fishers are also reporting 
savings in fuel and time in the water, as they can target their efforts to the 
best locations. 

The Ministry of Primary Industries is also very positive about the project. They 
recognise the value that such detailed and timely information provides beyond 
their stock assessment surveys. In the long term, providing robust evidence of 
good management is an important step towards the fishers being able to 
manage the resource themselves.
