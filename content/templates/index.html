      <p>We use statistical analysis so our clients can
      make decisions based on the best available information. We are independent, and we work with our
      clients in an open and engaged way.
      </p>
      
      <p>Our speciality is modern Bayesian analysis, which allows uncertainty to be
      carried all the way through from analysis to decision making. Bayesian modelling
      may be applied to a wide range of analytical problems, allowing best 
      use of limited information, or to properly account for variation in data-rich situations.
      We also use a wide range of machine-learning and simulation methods, as required by our clients.
      </p>
      <p>Our work is
      supported by excellent technical database and software-development skills. We build operation systems that
      allow organisations to get ongoing value from their data. Systems for data collection, management, nalysis, and reporting.
