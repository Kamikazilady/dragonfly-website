            <h2>Independent</h2>
            <p>We like challenging problems. These attract passionate people. Data science is about shifting discussions by bringing solid, reliable evidence to the conversation, letting objectivity take the heat out of the argument. We value our independence and don’t take sides. We insist on that.</p>
