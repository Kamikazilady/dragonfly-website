pen.  We like it open. Openness drives collaboration, informs discussion, and spreads the love. We work with clients who want to use information to drive innovation within their organisations, and we work with people who want to get information into the public domain, 

Engaged. We like our science, and its integrity. And we love being useful. We have published papers and chased pure research, but now we want to make it happen. If we can help change the world for the better, then we have succeeded. 

Curious. We want to know what’s going on. Science is all about getting to the bottom of it, and we are happy to dive deep. We have the technical skills to pick problems apart, and the creativity to find novel solutions. Our approach is fluid and pragmatic.

Independent. We like challenging problems. These attract passionate people. Data science is about shifting discussions by bringing solid, reliable evidence to the conversation, letting objectivity take the heat out of the argument. We value our independence and don’t take sides. We insist on that.
