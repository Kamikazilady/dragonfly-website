title: Broadcasting Kōkako over breakfast
---
Edward has been invited to talk at a Catalyst Cloud breakfast about how Dragonfly’s Kōkako technology makes use of the cloud computing platform. Kōkako uses machine learning to monitor the proportion of Māori language broadcast on New Zealand’s iwi radio stations.

“Every hour, we receive the iwi radio audio files as they are archived by [Ngā Taonga](http://www.ngataonga.org.nz/),” says Edward. “The audio files are large, and it’s a real advantage that they can be processed in Wellington rather than going to an international provider – faster and significantly cheaper.”  

Edward says Catalyst’s infrastructure also makes it really easy to host the intensive computation tasks that Kōkako relies on.

“We use it as an easy way to keep our servers running online 24-7. Catalyst provide all the backup and maintenance, which makes it really simple – we just connect up, it runs, and we get an invoice. We don’t have to worry about backups or maintenance – the product removes a whole layer of responsibility from us, which is great.”

The breakfast event features two other speakers, talking about their experience with Cloud.

“It’s nice to be able to tell our story. Machine learning is developing rapidly at the moment, and this is an application that’s up and running and being used to help support Māori language.”

Edward also sees plenty of opportunities for the technology to develop in new areas, such as classifying streaming media, like video.

“We’re especially interested in the development of video monitoring in fisheries and whether there are opportunities to help with processing the hours and hours of footage that gets recorded.”
