  abstract: Stirring in the Tasman Sea is examined using surface geostrophic currents
    derived from satellite altimeter measurements. Calculations of the distribution
    of finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLEs) indicate that the stirring in this region
    is not uniform and stretching rates over 15 days vary from less than 0.02 day$$^-1$$
    to over 0.3 day$$^-1$$. These variations occur at both small (  10 km) and large
    (  1000 km) scales, and in both cases are linked to dynamical features of the
    flow. The small scale variations are related to the characteristics of coherent
    vortex structures, and there are low FTLEs inside vortices and filaments of high
    FTLEs in strain-dominated regions surrounding these vortices. Regional variations
    in the stirring are closely related to variations in mesoscale activity and eddy
    kinetic energy (EKE). High values of mean FTLE occur in regions of high EKE (highest
    mean values of around 0.2 day$$^-1$$ occur in the EAC separation region) whereas
    small values occur in regions with low EKE (mean values around 0.03 day$$^-1$$
    in the east Tasman sea). There is a compact relationship between the mean FTLEs
    and EKE, raising the possibility of using the easily-calculated EKE to estimate
    the stirring. This possibility is even more intriguing as the FTLE distributions
    can be approximated, for the time scales considered here, by Weibull distributions
    with shape parameter equal to 1.6, which can be defined from the mean value alone.

  abstract: The Eastern Mediterranean is the largest oceanic ecosystem that is phosphate-limited.
    To determine the impact of a transient input we executed a phosphate addition
    experiment in the surface waters of the Cyprus Eddy (33.31oN 32.31oE), and compared
    the ecosystem response with surrounding unperturbed water. A tracer, sulphur hexafluoride
    (SF6), added with the phosphate, enabled tracking of the patch when phosphate
    concentration declined to detection limits, and provided quantitative estimates
    of mixing, dilution and patch volume. The patch expanded to greater than 400km2
    over 9 days with a lateral diffusion rate of 23 +/- 2 m2/s that was consistent
    with previous tracer releases in eddies. Mixed layer phosphate concentration was
     110 nmol/l immediately post-release, and declined to less than 5 nmol/l after
    6 days. A phosphate budget was developed using SF6 as a proxy to discriminate
    between dilution and biological pathways, with dilution resulting in loss of

  abstract: 'In this report, the number of New Zealand sea lion (Phocarctoshookeri)
    captures in New Zealand’s trawl fisheries are estimated for the1995–96 to 2006–07
    fishing years. Over this period, Ministry of Fisheriesobservers recorded the capture
    of between 5 and 39 sea lions within the NewZealand Exclusive Economic Zone, within
    each fishing year. During the 2006–07fishing year, 15 sea lions were observed
    killed on trawls. For the purposes ofthis report, three captures were included
    in this total that were observed onthe first day of the 2007–08 fishing year,
    in the last days of the southernblue whiting fishery. All of the captured sea
    lions were retrieved dead. Ofthe 15 sea lion captures, 7 were observed caught
    in the squid fishery aroundthe Auckland Islands. This was the lowest number of
    observed captures in thisfishery since the 1998–99 fishing year. Six sea lion
    captures were observed inthe southern blue whiting fishery east of Campbell Island,
    continuing a trendof increasing captures in that fishery since 2002. Two other
    capturesoccurred, one in the scampi fishery near the Auckland Islands, and one
    in thesquid fishery south of The Snares.From these observations, estimates of
    total captures were made for fourdifferent trawl fisheries: the squid fishery
    near the Auckland Islands; thesouthern blue whiting fishery east of Campbell Island;
    other (non-squid)fisheries near the Auckland Islands; and all trawl fisheries
    on the southern endof the Stewart- Snares shelf. Bayesian generalised linear models
    were fitted todata from the first two of these fisheries. A previous model, used
    forestimating sea lion captures in the 2004–05 fishing year, was re-implemented
    forthe Auckland Islands squid fishery. A new model was developed for the southernblue
    whiting fishery. Ratio estimates were calculated for the other (non-squid)Auckland
    Islands trawl fishery, and for all trawl fisheries on the southern endof the Stewart-Snares
    shelf.Over the 12 years of data, fishing effort in the squid fishery near the
    AucklandIslands was highest in the 1995–96 fishing year, with 4467 trawls being
    made.Effort then decreased to fewer than 2000 trawls in each year between 1997–98and
    2002–03. In each year between 2003–04 and 2005–06, over 2400 trawls weremade.
    The trawl effort fell to 1320 trawls in 2006–07.Since 2001, squid trawl nets in
    the Auckland Islands squid fishery haveincreasingly been fitted with sea lion
    exclusion devices (SLEDs) that allowanimals to escape from the net. The estimated
    interactions (captures andescapes via SLEDs) follow the patterns in effort. In
    1995–96 and 1996–97 therewere an estimated 141 and 140 interactions, respectively.
    In each year between1997–98 and 2002–03 there were fewer than 75 estimated interactions.
    For thethree years 2003–04 to 2005–06 there were 140 or more interactions. In

  abstract: A summary is presented of captures of seabirds and marinemammals in trawl
    and surface longline fisheries within the New ZealandExclusive Economic Zone (EEZ),
    for the first half of the 2007–08 fishing year(1 October 2007 to 31 March 2008,
    inclusive). Data from other fisheries, suchas bottom longline and set-net, were
    not available for the period covered.Ministry of Fisheries observers report captures
    of protected species when theyoccur, and these data are presented here. Observers
    in trawl fisheries recorded177 bird captures in the first half of 2007– 08, an
    increase from 124 birdcaptures in the first half of 2006–07. The most frequently
    caught birds in trawlfisheries were 65 sooty shearwater (Puffinus griseus), 45
    white-chinned petrel(Procellaria aequinoctialis) and 30 white-capped albatross
    (Thalassarchesteadi). Other captures included eight Salvin’s albatross (Thalassarchesalvini),
    three Buller’s albatross (Thalassarche bulleri), and single capturesof Campbell
    albatross (Thalassarche impavida) and southern royal albatross(Diomedea epomophora).
    One black petrel (Procellaria parkinsoni) was caught ina scampi trawl, and was
    confirmed by necropsy. A Westland petrel (Procellariawestlandica) was reported
    caught alive by an observer, but the identity couldnot be confirmed as it was
    released.There were 25 New Zealand fur seals (Arctocephalus forsteri) observed
    caught intrawl fisheries, 21 of them south of 48&\#9702; south. Seven New Zealand
    sea lions(Phocarctos hookeri) were caught, four of them in the Auckland Islands
    squidfishery and three in the southern blue whiting fishery to the east of CampbellIsland.
    There were 20 dolphins, identified by the observers as common dolphin(Delphinus
    delphis), caught in the jack mackerel fishery on the west coast ofthe North Island.
    This was twice as many as were observed caught in the firsthalf of 2006–07. No
    other species of marine mammal were observed caught, andthere were no marine mammals
    caught in surface longline fisheries. No turtleswere caught in either trawl or
    surface longline fisheries.Between the first half of 2006–07 and the first half
    of 2007–08 the total trawleffort decreased from 54 500 to 48 300 tows. In contrast,
    the number ofobserved tows increased from 3884 to 4436. Most bird captures were
    in the squidtrawl fishery. There was a small increase in the number of observed
    tows in thesquid fishery, from 1075 to 1194. Observed captures rose from 89 to
    136 birds,and the capture rate increased from 8.3 to 11.4 birds per one hundred
    tows.However, across all trawl fisheries, observed captures of white-capped albatrossdecreased
    from 42 to 30 birds. Observed captures of other albatross speciesincreased slightly
    from 12 to 14 birds. Of the 30 white-capped albatross caughtin the first half
    of 2007–08, only eight were caught on trawl warps. Coverage ofinshore trawl fisheries
    remains low. During the first half of the 2007–08 fishingyear 97 inshore trawls
    were observed, 0.3

    in New Zealand trawl fisheries. Between the 1995–96 and2007–08 fishing years,
    there were 97 common dolphin captures reported byMinistry of Fisheries observers
    in the mackerel trawl fishery on the westcoast of the North Island. These captures
    were all made by vessels over 90 min length. Capture events were infrequent, with
    1 trawl in every 100recording common dolphin captures. However, when common dolphins
    werecaught, they were often caught in groups. In 2007–08, 20 common dolphins werecaught
    on 5 of 725 observed tows. There were 9 common dolphins caught on asingle trawl.A
    statistical model was built that used the observer data to estimate the totalcommon
    dolphin captures in the mackerel fishery. A two-stage Bayesian hurdlemodel was
    used, with a logistic generalised linear model predicting whether anycommon dolphin
    captures occurred on a given tow, and a zero-truncated Poissondistribution being
    used to estimate the number of dolphin captures, given thatthere was a capture

  abstract: We examined the risk of fisheries incidental mortality causingpopulation
    declines for a suite of seabird species in 14 New Zealandfisheries using trawl
    and longline methods. We applied a method developed bySharp et al. (2009) that
    used the available data on species biology,fisheries interactions, and fishing
    effort in a semi-quantitative EcologicalRisk Assessment framework. Data quality
    was a strong pre-occupation in thestudy, with species abundance and productivity
    data being of extremelyvariable quality. Fishery data on captures were relatively
    sparse for smalllongline fisheries. Therefore, the results should be interpreted
    withcaution, and are best used to guide the setting of research and managementpriorities.
    Sixty-three species were studied, but the final analysis reportson data for 39,
    the remainder being excluded due to lack of data in therelevant fisheries at this

  abstract: An in situ mesoscale iron-fertilisation experiment in the eastern sub-Arctic
    Pacific (SERIES) was undertaken to test the Iron Hypothesis, that increasing iron
    supply would stimulate phytoplankton production and particulate organic carbon
    (POC) export to deep water. Patch dispersion was monitored for 26 days, using
    an inert tracer (SF6) and biological tracers (chlorophyll-a and fCO2), and we
    examine the vertical and lateral evolution of the patch, and the influence of
    dilution on the biological and biogeochemical response to iron addition. Vertical
    dispersion of the added iron was initially restricted to the upper 12 m by near-surface
    stratification, although the vertical flux to the lower mixed layer at this time
    significantly exceeded the unperturbed rate of iron supply. Calculation of vertical
    diffusion rates (Kz) provided an estimate of the unperturbed Fe flux across the
    seasonal pycnocline of 0.3–1.5 nmol/m2/d. The iron/tracer patch partially advected
    around an anticyclonic Haida Eddy that originated off the west coast of Canada
    in 1999–2000. Lateral patch evolution was initially dominated by current strain,
    stretching it into a filament of 300 km2 by day 11 and reaching a maximum area
    of 1300 km2 by day 23. Sustained high winds and intrusion of external waters between
    days 11 and 18 altered patch geometry and advection. Two scenarios for patch evolution
    are presented of a single exponential dilution at 0.1/d, and a variable dilution
    in which dilution increased from 0.078/d to 0.16/d (days 11–18) before decreasing
    to 0.05/d. Dilution rates were used to constrain dissolved iron dynamics, with
    iron regeneration rates indirectly estimated from biological iron uptake and lateral
    dilution losses. Lateral entrainment supplied 6–7 &\#956;mol/L silicic acid and
    4.6 &\#956;mol/L nitrate to the patch centre by day 20, equivalent to 37

  abstract: 1\. Landscape connectivity, the ability of species to move between different
    elements of a landscape, has been evaluated mainly by expert opinion, proxy data
    or homing experiments, all of which have major limitations. Cost distance modelling
    can overcome these limitations, but the resistance values of different landscape
    elements are difficult to estimate. 2. Here, we present a novel method combining
    step selection functions with cost distance modelling to assess functional landscape
    connectivity. Instead of relying on movement metrics, the method uses a case-control
    design to assess whether the chosen steps differ from a random sample of alternatives
    of similar lengths. Alternative models of landscape connectivity and dispersal
    behaviour are represented as maps of resistance values, and compared using an
    information-theoretic approach to select those hypotheses that maximize the discrepancy
    between chosen steps and random alternatives. 3. We applied this method to daily
    locations recorded along the dispersal paths of 38 juvenile North Island robins
    Petroica longipes in a fragmented pastoral landscape in New Zealand. We compared
    models with different resistance values for four recognized vegetation types in
    the landscape and assessed gap-crossing behaviour by changing the resistance value
    of pasture as a function of distance to the closest woody vegetation. 4. Model
    comparison showed that juvenile robins move in decreasing order of preference
    through native forest, plantations and shrubland, and showed a marked reluctance
    for flying over pasture. Under the best model, the largest gap crossed was 110
    m. 5. Synthesis and applications. In combination with data on the total cost distances
    travelled by dispersers, cost distance models of landscape connectivity can be
    used to predict distributions of dispersal distances in any landscape with similar
    vegetation types. They can therefore predict responses of species to landscape
    management or predict spatial dynamics of populations following reintroduction.
    Our method is potentially applicable to any dispersal data, even with a relatively
    small number of locations recorded in complex landscapes, meaning models can be
    fitted to data that cannot be analysed using previous method. Tools are freely
    available for download to allow researchers and wildlife managers to apply our
    methods to their own data.

  abstract: 'The discard of processing waste by fishing trawlers attracts seabirds,
    putting them at risk from being caught in nets or being struck by fishing gear.
    In order to minimise the impact of fishing on seabird populations, techniques
    are required for managing processing waste so that fewer birds are attracted to
    the stern of trawlers. A simple method, that may reduce the number of birds attracted
    to trawlers, is to discharge the waste in batches: holding the waste and dumping
    it periodically, rather than discharging it continuously. In a previous experiment,
    waste was held for a range of intervals (between 30 minutes and 8 hours), and
    the influence of discharge interval on seabird abundance was determined. It was
    found that there were fewer birds behind the vessel when the interval between
    batches was either 4 or 8 hours long, rather than when it was either 30 minutes
    or 2 hours. In February and March 2010, a similar experiment was carried out on
    a trawler that was mainly targeting hoki. The key difference was that this experiment
    compared the number of birds behind the vessel during continuous discharge with
    the number that were present with either a 30-minute or 2-hour interval between
    waste discharges. During the experiment, fishing was carried out normally, with
    the waste discharge being controlled as part of the experiment. For each day of
    the experiment a particular discharge regime was followed (either continuous,
    30-minute, or 2-hour). A fisheries observer recorded the abundance of seabirds
    (large seabirds, Cape petrels, and other small seabirds) within 40 m from the
    stern of the vessel, making series of up to 12 observations spaced 5 minutes apart.
    During batched treatments, the observations began 5 to 10 minutes before a discharge
    event. In this report, a preliminary analysis of data from the experiment is presented.
    Although the level of statistical significance was not tested, the seabird abundance
    at the back of the vessel was similar between treatments when waste was discharged,
    but the abundance was reduced by half in absence of discharge. As a consequence,
    across all the observation periods the seabird abundance was lowest when waste
    was discharged every two hours, slightly higher when the discharge interval was
    30 minutes, and highest when the waste was continuously discharged. Observations
    of the 2-hour batch discharge treatment did not cover the whole period between
    discharge events, and so a larger difference between the 2 hour and other treatments
    may be expected. During the 2-hour treatment, waste discharge took an average
    of around 9 minutes, whereas during the 30-minute treatment waste discharge took
    an average of 3 minutes. The rapid response of seabird numbers and behaviour to
    the individual discharge events could not be determined, as observations were
    made 5 minutes apart. A fixed video camera was used to continuously record a view
    looking back from the stern of the vessel. This footage has not yet been analysed.
    Both large and small seabirds responded similarly to the discharge treatments,
    and there was no apparent relationship between seabird abundance and other variables,
    such as vessel speed, swell height, or wind strength. The experiment was successfully
    conducted, with the protocol being closely followed. The preliminary descriptive
    analysis suggests that batching fishing waste may represent an efficient strategy
    in reducing the number of seabirds that are attracted to trawlers. Statistical
    modelling of the data would help determine the significance of this key result.'

  abstract: The physical and biogeochemical setting of the Southern Ocean Iron Release
    Experiment (SOIREE) is described. SOIREE was carried out in the southern Antarctic
    Zone (61o S, 140o E), between the southern branch of the Polar Front and the southern
    front of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The region is characterized by weak
    currents, high nutrients, low chlorophyll, moderate summer mixed layer depth,
    and is remote from the influence of sea-ice and coastal waters. In other words,
    the SOIREE site is typical of a broad area of the open ocean waters of the Southern
    Ocean. SOIREE was carried out in late summer (February), close to the time of
    maximum seasonal nutrient depletion and well past the usual seasonal peak in production
    and export. While the seasonal nutrient draw-down is substantial, levels of all
    three macro-nutrients remain high enough to support phytoplankton growth. In contrast,
    north of the southern branch of the Polar Front, silica is drawn down to levels
    which are potentially limiting for growth of large diatoms. The response to iron
    addition may therefore vary with season, at least to the north of the southern
    branch of the PF. The extent and consequences of silica limitation in Southern
    Ocean waters appear to have been under-appreciated. Only waters south of the southern
    branch of the Polar Front are high in silica year-round. In particular, water
    masses formed in the Southern Ocean sink with little pre-formed silicate (Antarctic
    Bottom Water (AABW) is an exception, but sinking of AABW is limited to a few small
    regions along the Antarctic margin). Therefore, in the absence of physiological
    changes, adding iron is likely to have little effect on carbon export by the silica
    pump, which plays the dominant role in carbon export in both the modern and glacial
    Southern Ocean. As a consequence, it may not be as easy to draw down all the macro-nutrients
    in the Southern Ocean as previously assumed in assessing the response of the global
    carbon cycle to iron fertilization. The iron hypothesis for glacial-interglacial
    changes in carbon dioxide requires that the silica limitation be alleviated in
    waters north of the present-day Polar Front (by changes in ocean circulation),
    as well as an increase in aeolian iron supply.

  abstract: 'Seabirds are caught during commercial fishing, most frequentlyeither
    by being hooked during longlining, caught in trawl nets, or struck bytrawl warps.
    In order to understand the impact of fishing on seabird species,estimates of the
    total mortality from fishing activity must be obtained. InNew Zealand commercial
    fisheries, government observers are present on somevessels, and they record any
    captures of protected species that occur. Theseobserver data provide a consistent
    basis for estimating total captures.In this report, generalized linear models
    were used to estimate total capturesof seabirds by trawl and longline methods
    from observer data. Captures wereestimated for the fishing years 2002–03 to 2006–
    07, by fishing within the NewZealand Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). For trawl,
    bottom longline, and surfacelongline fisheries, statistical models were built
    of captures of five speciesgroups: white-capped albatross (Thalassarche steadi),
    sooty shearwater (Puffinusgriseus), white-chinned petrel (Procellaria aequinoctialis),
    other albatrossspecies, and other birds. The models were fitted using Bayesian
    methods, withthe captures represented as samples from a negative binomial distribution.The
    total number of seabirds that were estimated to have been caught within NewZealand
    waters during the 2006–07 fishing year was 3554 (95'

  abstract: 'Recent research has shown that collisions with trawl warps are asource
    of seabird mortality in trawl fisheries. To minimise this mortality, anumber of
    devices have been developed to prevent seabirds from being struckby the trawl
    warps, or from congregating at the stern of the vessels. Designscurrently used
    in New Zealand include twin tori lines, bird bafflers and warpscarers. Legislation
    now requires that at least one of these devices is usedby trawlers fishing within
    New Zealand waters. Experimental trials of warp strike mitigation devices were
    carried out in the 2006 southern squid trawlfishery, involving 18 observed vessels.
    The trials were developedco-operatively by a group that included representatives
    from the fishingindustry, the Ministry of Fisheries, the Department of Conservation
    andWWF-NZ. Tori lines, bird bafflers (the 4 boom variety) and warp scarers werecompared
    using standardised seabird strike measurements: the number of birdsthat struck
    either the warps or the mitigation device during a 15 minuteobservation period.
    On the participating trips, different warp strikemitigation treatments were used
    on different tows according to a randomisedexperimental design. Key results from
    the trial are: - Tori lines were most effective at reducing seabird strikes on
    trawl warps. They reduced the warp strikes to between 5'

  abstract: New Zealand fur seals (Arctocephalus forsteri) have been caughtin commercial
    trawl fisheries operating around New Zealand’s EEZ. Ministry ofFisheries observers
    recorded 141 fur seal captures in trawl fisheries in2007–08, and 72 in 2006–07.
    Fur seals were the most frequently observed non-fishbycatch species in 2007–08.
    Captures have been reported from trawlers operatingthroughout New Zealand’s EEZ,
    with the exception of the north and east coastsof the North Island. Most captures
    have been observed in the hoki fishery, with57 fur seals being observed caught
    in 2007–08. In contrast, few captures werereported from deepwater or scampi fisheries.A
    Bayesian generalised linear model was developed using the observed trawleffort.
    The model was fitted to data from six fishing years, 1 October 2002 to 30September
    2008. The model was then used to estimate fur seal captures onunobserved tows.
    Trawl effort from the north and east of the North Island, andfrom the eastern
    end of the Chatham Rise, was excluded because there were noobserved fur seal captures
    in those areas. Trawl effort from tows targetinginshore species was also excluded
    as observer coverage in inshore fisheries wasvery low, and no fur seals were observed
    caught. The model included covariatesfor fishing area, target species, day of
    the year, and distance to the shore.These covariates, which have been identified
    in previous work, were selectedbecause they explained much of the variation in
    the capture rate.In 2007–08, an estimated 714 (95

    captures in New Zealand’s trawl fisheries are estimated for the 1995–96to 2007–08
    fishing years. Over this period, Ministry of Fisheries observersrecorded the capture
    of between 5 and 39 sea lions within the New ZealandExclusive Economic Zone, within
    each fishing year. During the 2007–08 fishingyear, 8 sea lions were observed captured
    on trawls. This count excludes 3captures observed on the first day of the 2007–08
    fishing year, in the last daysof the southern blue whiting fishery. Seven of the
    8 captured sea lions wereretrieved dead, and 1 was released alive. Of the 8 sea
    lion captures, 5 wereobserved caught in the squid fishery around the Auckland
    Islands. This was thelowest number of observed captures in this fishery since
    the 1998–99 fishingyear. Two sea lion captures were observed in the southern blue
    whiting fisheryeast of Campbell Island, a decrease from 6 captures the year before.
    There wereno sea lion captures in the Auckland Islands scampi fishery or any otherAuckland
    Islands trawl fishery. One sea lion was caught on an observed trawl inthe hoki
    fishery south of The Snares and released alive.From these observations, estimates
    of total captures were made for fourdifferent strata: the squid fishery near the
    Auckland Islands; the CampbellIsland southern blue whiting fishery; other (non-squid)
    trawl fisheries near theAuckland Islands; and all trawl fisheries on the southern
    end of theStewart-Snares shelf. Bayesian generalised linear models were fitted
    to datafrom the first two of these strata. A previous model, used for estimating

    squid fishery. Likewise, the model developed in 2006–07 for the CampbellIsland
    southern blue whiting fishery was re-implemented, with minor changes.Ratio estimates
    were calculated for the remaining two strata.Since 2001, trawl nets in the Auckland
    Islands squid fishery have increasinglybeen fitted with sea lion exclusion devices
    (SLEDs) that allow animals to escapefrom the net. The model estimated that the

  abstract: Exploratory data analysis of a high resolution (hook-by-hook), 6-year
    time series (1993 – 98) of observed longline catch data for tunas was used to
    investigate fine-scale spatial patterns along individual sets that may be indicative
    of social behaviour (i.e., schooling) and/or the response of individual fish to
    favourable extrinsic conditions (i.e., aggregation). Methods of spatial data analysis
    (i.e., nearest neighbour analysis) that have previously been applied in various
    other sciences (e.g., forestry and astronomy) were used. Results indicate strong
    clustering of individual tunas at characteristic scales within the set. Mean Nearest
    Neighbour Distances (NNDs) were between 100 and 200 m, compared with NNDs of 200–700
    m predicted by a heterogeneous Poisson process on the same spatial domain. The
    results suggest that these adult tunas were either schooling or aggregating at
    the time of capture; this may therefore be related either to social behaviour
    or to sub-mesoscale oceanographic features. An aggregation index was derived from
    the NNDs, giving a classification method that may be used for similar data and
    the development of empirical models attempting to relate patterns in fish catch
    distributions to environmental variables. The success of such models will ultimately
    depend on elucidating the ecological processes reflected in oceanographic features
    at biologically meaningful spatial scales.

  abstract: Habitat loss and fragmentation are recognised worldwide as contributing
    to declines and extinctions of species. However, the biological factors underlying
    the effects of fragmentation are still often poorly understood, possibly due to
    the diversity of scales and approaches taken by researchers. I propose in this
    thesis an integrative approach that can be applied to any taxa and landscape,
    using a metapopulation of North Island robins (Petroica longipes) inhabiting forest
    patches of a fragmented agricultural landscape of New Zealand. In particular,
    I attempt to integrate the effects of habitat fragmentation on both habitat quality
    and the dispersal-driven broad scale dynamics of populations. I first analysed
    the distribution of robins based on presence-absence data, relating presence-absence
    to local habitat factors as well as size and isolation of forest patches (Chapter
    2). Their distribution was found to be primarily limited by the isolation of forest
    patches, but was also related to some habitat factors. However, habitat fragmentation
    was not found to affect habitat quality, as the factors found to affect survival
    and productivity were unrelated to size and isolation, independent from the size
    or isolation of forest patches (Chapter 3). Based on the radio-tracking of juvenile
    robins, I applied a choice analysis technique to show that robins need woody vegetation
    for their natal dispersal and that they are unlikely to cross stretches of pasture
    greater than 150 m (Chapter 4). Juveniles dispersed a median Euclidean distance
    of 1 129 m with a maximum of 11 km, whereas I predicted from the data that they
    would have dispersed a median distance of 3 km in continuous forest with a maximum
    of 20 km (Chapter 5). The consequences of this dispersal limitation and of variations
    in habitat quality were assessed using a spatially-explicit individual-based metapopulation
    model that incorporated realistic gap-limited dispersal behaviour of juvenile
    robins (Chapter 6). Whereas the movement of individuals between patches is commonly
    assumed to improve the persistence of populations, I found that a weaker gap-crossing
    ability, and therefore reduced landscape connectivity, increased the metapopulation
    size at equilibrium. This study highlights the complex effects of habitat loss
    and fragmentation on the distribution of species, but also the limits of excessive
    model simplification.

    observers in the mackerel trawl fishery on the westcoast of the North Island.
    All captures were by vessels over 90 m length. Thepattern of captures was similar
    across fishing years, with a general increasein fishing effort and a concomitant
    increase in common dolphin captures overthe 14-year period. In the most recent
    fishing year, 2008–09, fishing effortwas comparatively lower than in preceding
    years, and 11 common dolphins werecaught in 4 of 510 tows. Capture events frequently
    involved the capture ofmore than one individual, with a maximum of 9 common dolphins
    observed caughtin a single tow.Based on observer data, a statistical model was
    built that estimated the totalnumber of common dolphin captures in the large vessel
    mackerel fishery. Atwo-stage Bayesian hurdle model was used, with a logistic generalised
    linearmodel predicting whether any common dolphin captures occurred on a given
    tow,and a zero-truncated Poisson distribution to estimate the number of dolphincaptures,
    given that there was a capture event. The model was also used toexplore which
    covariates were related to common dolphin captures.There was little effort in
    the large vessel mackerel fishery before 2001–02,with fewer than 1000 tows per
    year. The estimated number of common dolphincaptures was also relatively small,
    with a median of less than 12 capturesannually. As the effort in this fishery
    expanded to over 2000 tows by 2002–03,there was an initial increase in the estimated
    number of common dolphins caughtper year to 182 (95

  abstract: 'Seabirds are caught during commercial fishing, most frequently by being
    hooked during longlining, caught in trawl nets, or struck by trawl warps. In order
    to understand the impact of fishing on seabird species, estimates of the total
    mortality from fishing activity must be obtained. In New Zealand commercial fisheries,
    government observers are present on some vessels, and they record any captures
    of seabirds and other protected species that occur.Generalized linear models were
    used to estimate total captures of seabirds by trawl and longline methods from
    the observer data. Captures were estimated for trawl, bottom longline, and surface
    longline fisheries, for the 2002–03 to 2008–09 fishing years (with some models
    extending back to 1998–99). The estimates were for fishing within the outer boundary
    of New Zealand Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Statistical models were built of
    captures of five species groups: white-capped albatross (Thalassarche steadi),
    sooty shearwater (Puffinus griseus), white-chinned petrel (Procellaria aequinoctialis),
    other albatross species, and other birds. The models were fitted using Bayesian
    methods, with the captures represented as samples from a negative binomial distribution.The
    total number of seabirds that were estimated to have been caught within New Zealand
    watersduring the 2008–09 fishing year was 3224 (95'

  abstract: The decline of avian populations in fragmented landscapes is often attributed
    to a decrease in nest survival rates for species breeding within these habitats.
    We tested whether fragment size and connectivity, livestock grazing, predator
    density or invertebrate biomass were correlated with nest survival rates for an
    endemic New Zealand species, the North Island robin (Petroica longipes). Across
    three breeding seasons (2002-2005) daily nest survival rate for the 203 robin
    nests monitored in 15 forest fragments was 0.315 (SE 0.003), with nest survival
    rates increasing with invertebrate biomass (indexed with pitfall traps) and marginally
    decreasing with fragment size. Footprint tracking rates for exotic ship rats (Rattus
    rattus), which are likely to be the key nest predator, varied greatly among fragments,
    but were not a useful predictor of nest survival. We found no relationship between
    the number of fledglings per successful nesting attempt and invertebrate biomass.
    We conclude that fragment size and connectivity does not appear to be negatively
    influencing robin nest survival, potentially because of the already high impact
    that mammalian nest predators have in this unique system.

  abstract: Sea urchin feeding fronts are a striking example of spatial pattern formation
    in an ecological system. If it is assumed that urchins are asocial, and that they
    move randomly, then the formation of these dense fronts is an apparent paradox.
    The key lies in observations that urchins move further in areas where their algal
    food is less plentiful. This naturally leads to the accumulation of urchins in
    areas with abundant algae. If urchin movement is represented as a random walk,
    with a step size that depends on algal concentration, then their movement may
    be described by a Fokker-Planck diffusion equation. For certain combinations of
    algal growth and urchin grazing, travelling wave solutions are obtained. Two dimensional
    simulations of urchin algal dynamics show that an initially uniformly distributed
    urchin population, grazing on an alga with a smoothly varying density, may form
    a propagating front separating two sharply delineated regions. On one side of
    the front algal density is uniformly low, and on the other side of the front algal
    density is uniformly high. Bounds on when stable fronts will form are obtained
    in terms of urchin density and grazing, and algal growth.

  abstract: Current-meter, temperature, and microstructure observations of the large-amplitude
    internal tide shoaling on the continental shelf of the east coast of northern
    New Zealand show the complexity of the internal kinematics and mixing. The propagation
    speed of the main internal wave was around 0.3 m s$$^-1$$, and nonstationary time
    series analysis was used to locate the trailing short-wavelength internal waves
    in frequency (periods of around 40 min) and tidal-phase space. The average energy
    dissipation rate (5 x 10$$^-8$$ m2 s$$^-3$$) was an order of magnitude smaller
    than that observed on the open shelf in other studies, but peaks in dissipation
    rate were measured to be much greater. The vertical diffusivity of heat was around
    10$$^-4$$ m2 s$$^-1$$, comparable to, or greater than, other studies. Examples
    of the scale and sporadic nature of larger mixing events were observed. The behavior
    was complicated by the nearby steeply shoaling coast of the Poor Knight Islands.
    Consistent reflected wave energy was not apparent.

  abstract: Because of finite resources, organisms face conflict between their own
    self-care and reproduction. This conflict is especially apparent in avian species
    with female-only incubation, where females face a trade-off between time allocated
    to their own self-maintenance and the thermal requirements of developing embryos.
    We recorded incubation behaviour of the New Zealand robin (Petroica longipes),
    a species with female-only incubation, male incubation feeding and high nest predation
    rates. We examined how male incubation feeding, ambient temperature and food availability
    (invertebrate biomass) affected the different components of females’ incubation
    behaviour and whether incubation behaviour explained variation in nest survival.
    Our results suggest that male incubation feeding rates of 2.8 per hour affect
    the female’s incubation rhythm by reducing both on- and off-bout duration, resulting
    in no effect on female nest attentiveness, thus no support for the female-nutritional
    hypothesis. The incubation behaviours that we measured did not explain nest survival,
    despite high nest predation rates. Increased ambient temperature caused an increase
    in off-bout duration, whereas increased food availability increased on-bout duration.
    While males play a vital role in influencing incubation behaviour, female robins
    attempt to resolve the trade-off between their own foraging needs and the thermal
    requirements of their developing embryos via alternating their incubation rhythm
    in relation to both food and temperature.

  abstract: Iron supply has a key role in stimulating phytoplankton blooms in high-nitrate
    low-chlorophyll oceanic waters. However, the fate of the carbon fixed by these
    blooms, and how efficiently it is exported into the ocean’s interior, remains
    largely unknown. Here we report on the decline and fate of an iron-stimulated
    diatom bloom in the Gulf of Alaska. The bloom terminated on day 18, following
    the depletion of iron and then silicic acid, after which mixed-layer particulate
    organic carbon (POC) concentrations declined over six days. Increased particulate
    silica export via sinking diatoms was recorded in sediment traps at depths between
    50 and 125 m from day 21, yet increased POC export was not evident until day 24.
    Only a small proportion of the mixed-layer POC was intercepted by the traps, with
    more than half of the mixed-layer POC deficit attributable to bacterial remineralization
    and mesozooplankton grazing. The depletion of silicic acid and the inefficient
    transfer of iron-increased POC below the permanent thermocline have major implications
    both for the biogeochemical interpretation of times of greater iron supply in
    the geological past, and also for proposed geo-engineering schemes to increase
    oceanic carbon sequestration.

  abstract: In the children’s game of rock-scissors-paper, players each choose one
    of three strategies. A rock beats a pair of scissors, scissors beat a sheet of
    paper and paper beats a rock, so the strategies form a competitive cycle. Although
    cycles in competitive ability appear to be reasonably rare among terrestrial plants,
    they are common among marine sessile organisms and have been reported in other
    contexts. Here we consider a system with three species in a competitive loop and
    show that this simple ecology exhibits two counter-intuitive phenomena. First,
    the species that is least competitive is expected to have the largest population
    and, where there are oscillations in a finite population, to be the least likely
    to die out. As a consequence an apparent weakening of a species leads to an increase
    in its population. Second, evolution favours the most competitive individuals
    within a species, which leads to a decline in its population. This is analogous
    to the tragedy of the commons, but here, rather than leading to a collapse, the
    ’tragedy’ acts to maintain diversity.

    Observed captures in trawl fisheries, surface longline fisheries,and setnet fisheries
    increased compared to the 2007–08 year, and observedcaptures in bottom longline
    fisheries decreased. The most frequently caughtseabird species were sooty shearwater,

  abstract: The importance of habitat selection processes and dispersal to the functioning
    of subdivided populations has been shown by theoretical approaches, but few empirical
    studies have dealt with the underlying behavioural mechanisms and their ecological
    implications. Breeding populations of seabirds are naturally subdivided at different
    spatial scales and represent good models to study these processes. In particular,
    detailed observations on a kittiwake Rissa tridactyla population in Brittany,
    France, suggested that individuals use the reproductive success of conspecifics
    for selecting among potential breeding patches. In particular, failed breeders
    and young prospecting birds were suspected to be attracted successful areas. The
    observational data used nevertheless did not permit to ascertain the causal nature
    of the associations observed. The aim of the present work was to test experimentally
    several predictions of this hypothesis. Specifically, we manipulated the local
    reproductive success of kittiwakes on a set of study plots in order to test the
    behavioural responses of the birds in terms of attendance of local breeders and
    prospecting individuals. The experiment was carried out on the island of Horn&\#248;ya,
    Norway, and local success was manipulated by reducing or increasing brood size
    during incubation on a series of replicated plots. Lower attendance of local breeders
    following their breeding failure and lower prospecting by birds that did not breed
    on the plot was predicted for plots with reduced local reproductive success. Conversely,
    we predicted higher attendance of failed breeders and prospectors on plots where
    a high success was maintained. We also predicted that a higher proportion of failed
    breeders from unsuccessful plots would be recorded prospecting for sites compared
    to failed breeders from successful plots. Finally, behavioural responses were
    expected to be stronger on isolated cliffs compared to plots adjacent to productive
    areas. Our results are discussed in relation to factors determining heterogeneity
    among individuals, nest site availability and patch quality at different scales.
    Understanding the behavioural mechanisms behind differential dispersal and recruitment
    among breeding patches is crucial for studying the dynamics of subdivided populations
    and has direct conservation implications for species like seabirds.

  abstract: The growth of populations is known to be influenced by dispersal, which
    has often been described as purely diffusive. In the open ocean, however, the
    tendrils and filaments of phytoplankton populations provide evidence for dispersal
    by stirring. Despite the apparent importance of horizontal stirring for plankton
    ecology, this process remains poorly characterized. Here we investigate the development
    of a discrete phytoplankton bloom, which was initiated by the iron fertilization
    of a patch of water (7 km in diameter) in the Southern Ocean. Satellite images
    show a striking, 150-km-long bloom near the experimental site, six weeks after
    the initial fertilization. We argue that the ribbon-like bloom was produced from
    the fertilized patch through stirring, growth and diffusion, and we derive an
    estimate of the stirring rate. In this case, stirring acts as an important control
    on bloom development, mixing phytoplankton and iron out of the patch, but also
    entraining silicate. This may have prevented the onset of silicate limitation,
    and so allowed the bloom to continue for as long as there was sufficient iron.
    Stirring in the ocean is likely to be variable, so blooms that are initially similar
    may develop very differently.

  abstract: The Prisoner’s Dilemma (PD) involves contests between two players, and
    may naturally be played on a spatial grid using voter model rules. In the model
    of spatial PD discussed here, the sites of a 2 dimensional lattice are occupied
    by strategies. At each time-step a site is chosen to play a PD game with one of
    its neighbors. The strategy of the chosen site then invades its neighbor with
    a probability which is proportional to the pay-off from the game. Using results
    from the analysis of voter models, it is shown that with simple linear strategies
    this scenario results in the long-term survival of only one strategy. If three
    non-linear strategies have a cyclic dominance relation between one-another, then
    it is possible for relatively cooperative strategies to persist indefinitely.
    With the voter model dynamics, however, the average level of cooperation decreases
    with time if mutation of the strategies is included. Spatial effects are not in
    themselves sufficient to lead to the maintenance of cooperation.

  abstract: 'Observations of phytoplankton physiology collected using a fast repetition-rate
    fluorometer (FRRF) in the vicinity of a shelf-sea tidal-mixing front are presented.
    These data are combined with more traditional 14C-based measurements and observations
    of environmental parameters, including estimates of turbulent dissipation rates,
    in order to investigate the influence of physical forcing on the productivity
    of the system. Low nutrient concentrations on the stratified side of the front
    result in a reduction of photosynthetic efficiency. Conversely, the high degree
    of vertical mixing on the mixed side of the front constrains the ability of phytoplankton
    to adjust their photosynthetic apparatus to the ambient irradiance field. Redistribution
    of phytoplankton biomass and variations in physiological parameters also result
    from the spring-neap tidal cycle. FRRF- and 14C-derived physiological measurements
    are compared in the context of environmental gradients in the region. A strong
    correlation was found between independently measured functional absorption cross-sections
    (\

    sigma<span style="vertical-align:sub;">PSII</span>) and maximal photosynthetic
    rates (P\*max). Such a relationship was unlikely to have been causative and may
    have resulted from shifts in the balance between light-harvesting and carbon fixation
    across the front. The association of changes in P\*max with variations in\

    sigma<span style="vertical-align:sub;">PSII</span> provided the basis for the
    development of an empirical model, specific to the system and time of study, which
    utilised FRRF data to extrapolate between primary productivity rates measured
    at fixed sites. When applied to high resolution cross-frontal data, the model
    suggested small-scale variations in productivity related to both spatial and temporal
    physical forcing including the spring-neap cycle.'

  abstract: In the 12 years from 1 October 1995 to 30 September 2007, atotal of 107
    dolphin captures were reported by Ministry of Fisheriesobservers in trawl and
    longline fisheries within New Zealand’s ExclusiveEconomic Zone. These captures
    included 80 common dolphins, 9 pilot whales,and 7 dusky dolphins that were reported
    killed in trawl fisheries. In longlinefisheries over the same period, eight dolphins
    were captured and releasedalive, with one common dolphin and two pilot whales
    reported killed. Therehave been few observations in inshore trawl fisheries, and
    no data wereavailable from setnet fisheries. Hector’s dolphin captures have previouslybeen
    reported from both setnet and inshore trawl fisheries, but the observerdatabase
    does not contain enough information to estimate the captures ofeither Hector’s
    or Maui’s dolphins.The jack mackerel trawl fishery, operating off the west coast

  abstract: Results are presented from a repeat of previous mincing experiments, conducted
    during two trips, primarily targeting hoki, on the east coast of the South Island
    of New Zealand in early 2008. As in the earlier experiments, the numbers of seabirds
    behind the vessel were counted, and the response of these counts to different
    treatments of the waste stream was determined. The machinery used for macerating
    the offal was developed specifically for the vessel used, and the protocol was
    modified so that more data could be collected. This experiment continues a series
    of work aimed at reducing the bycatch of seabirds in New Zealand fisheries, including
    studies of the efficacy of mitigation and previous trials of different offal management
    strategies.

  abstract: Diffusive processes are often used to represent the formation of spatial
    patterns in biological systems. Here I show how patchiness may be generated in
    planktonic ecosystems through nondiffusive advection. Plankton distributions in
    oceanic surface waters can be characterized by the spectra of concentrations obtained
    along ship transects. Such spectra are inevitably found to have a power-law formover
    horizontal scales ranging from 1 to 100km. Phytoplankton have distributions similar
    to those of physical quantities such as sea surface temperature, with much less
    variability at shorter length scales. In contrast, zooplankton density may be
    almost as variable at short scales as long ones. Distributions of this form are
    generated in a model of the turbulent stirring of coupled phytoplankton and zooplankton
    populations. The characteristic spatial patterns of the phytoplankton and zooplankton
    are a consequence of the timescales of their response to changes in their environment
    caused by turbulent advection.

  abstract: Recent work aimed at reducing the capture of seabirds on trawlwarps has
    shown that warp strikes are associated with the discharge of wastewhile fishing.
    Offal management is therefore a key measure for reducing thisincidental catch.
    An experiment to test the effect of two offal managementstrategies on the numbers
    of seabirds attending a fishing trawler was carriedout during September - October,
    2006. The two treatments were (1) sending alloffal and waste to the meal plant,
    so that discharge was reduced to sumpwater, and (2) passing all waste through
    a mincer, with 25mm holes in themincing plate, before discharging it. The two
    treatments were compared with acontrol, where all waste was directly discharged.
    To determine the response to the treatments, bird numbers were counted in a semicircular
    sweep of 40mradius, centered on the middle of the stern of the vessel and extendingbehind
    it. Birds were counted in five species groups (large albatross, smallalbatross,
    giant petrel, shearwaters and others, cape petrels) and threebehavioural categories
    (flying, sitting and feeding). The trial covered 21days, with 7 days of each of
    the two treatments and the control. During theexperiment the vessel fished for
    hoki off the east coast of the South Island,and also on the Stewart Snares shelf.
    The mincing treatment did not significantly the numbers of birds within the count
    area, with the exceptionof feeding large albatross (Diomedea spp.). When the waste
    was mealed,numbers of feeding birds reduced markedly. The effect was most pronounced
    forthe smaller albatross (Thalassarche spp.). Within this group, the numbers offeeding
    birds reduced to 5.3

  abstract: Artificial nests are frequently used to assess factors affecting survival
    of natural bird nests. We tested the potential for artificial nests to be used
    in a novel application, the prediction of nest predation rates at potential reintroduction
    sites where exotic predators are being controlled. We collected artificial nest
    data from nine sites with different predator control regimes around the North
    Island of New Zealand, and compared the nest survival rates with those of North
    Island robin (Petroica longipes) nests at the same sites. Most of the robin populations
    had been reintroduced in the last 10 years, and were known to vary in nest survival
    and status (increasing/stable or declining). We derived estimates of robin nest
    survival for each site based on Stanley estimates of daily survival probabilities
    and the known incubation and brooding periods of robins. Estimates of artificial
    nest survival for each site were derived using the known fate model in MARK. We
    identified the imprints on the clay eggs in the artificial nests, and obtained
    different estimates of artificial nest survival based on imprints made by different
    potential predators. We then compared the value of these estimates for predicting
    natural nest survival, assuming a relationship of the form s = alpha p super(
    beta ), where s is natural nest survival and p is artificial nest survival. Artificial
    nest survival estimates based on imprints made by rats (Rattus spp.) and brushtail
    possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) were clearly the best predictors (based on AICc),
    and explained 64\

  abstract: Seiche currents were observed in Wellington Harbour, New Zealand, with
    an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP). A 600 kHz Broad-Band ADCP was deployed
    on the sea bed in Evans Bay in an upwards looking configuration for 20 days. The
    measured seiche periods were 159, 26, 17.3, and 8.3 min and there was evidence
    for seiching at periods of 15.8 and 14.7 min. These observations are in close
    agreement with the previous predictions of a finite-difference numerical model.
    The seiching occurred during periods of wind with speeds in excess of 10 m s$$^-1$$.
    The seiches were found to be barotropic.

  abstract: The evolutionary persistence of symbiotic associations is a puzzle. Adaptation
    should eliminate cooperative traits if it is possible to enjoy the advantages
    of cooperation without reciprocating - a facet of cooperation known in game theory
    as the Prisoner’s Dilemma. Despite this barrier, symbioses are widespread, and
    may have been necessary for the evolution of complex life. The discovery of strategies
    such as tit-for-tat has been presented as a general solution to the problem of
    cooperation. However, this only holds for within-species cooperation, where a
    single strategy will come to dominate the population. In a symbiotic association
    each species may have a different strategy, and the theoretical analysis of the
    single species problem is no guide to the outcome. We present basic analysis of
    two-species cooperation and show that a species with a fast adaptation rate is
    enslaved by a slowly evolving one. Paradoxically, the rapidly evolving species
    becomes highly cooperative, whereas the slowly evolving one gives little in return.
    This helps understand the occurrence of endosymbioses where the host benefits,
    but the symbionts appear to gain little from the association.

  abstract: 'Dispersion of the tracer sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) during the Southern
    Ocean Iron Enrichment Experiment (SOIREE) provided an estimate of vertical exchange
    at the base of the surface mixed layer (60 m) at 61oS 140oE. Budget analysis confirmed
    that the SF6 patch was well constrained by surface mapping, with the decline in
    total SF6 showing good agreement with that predicted from wind speed parameterizations.
    Two approaches were used to calculate the mean effective vertical diffusivity
    Kz from the diapycnal transfer of SF6, with complementary error function and second-moment
    fits to the SF6 depth profiles indicating that Kz was less than 0.3\

    times 10<span style="vertical-align:sup;">-4</span> m<span style="vertical-align:sup;">2</span>
    s<span style="vertical-align:sup;">-1</span>. This result was examined using a
    three-dimensional diffusion model that incorporated lateral dispersion and air-sea
    exchange losses, which confirmed that vertical shear and subpycnocline dispersion
    did not influence the Kz estimate. Current shear at the base of the mixed layer
    was generated by wind-driven inertial oscillation, with a decrease in wind speed
    and increasing stratification in the latter half of the experiment reducing diapycnal
    transfer of SF6. A compilation was used to examine the potential of both N (Brunt-Vaisala
    frequency) and Ri (gradient Richardson number) on the basis of parameterizations
    of Kz in the seasonal pycnocline. Application of Kz to nutrient gradients in the
    seasonal pycnocline suggests that vertical diffusion represents a significant
    pathway for silicic acid supply in late summer. Furthermore, use of the mean effective
    Kz (0.11\

  abstract: 'In this report, the number of New Zealand sea lion (Phocarctos hookeri)
    captures in New Zealand’s trawl fisheries are estimated for the 1995–96 to 2008–09
    fishing years. Ministry of Fisheries observers reported the capture of three New
    Zealand sea lions (Phocarctos hookeri) during the 2008–09 fishing year. This was
    the lowest number of observed captures in the period covered by the data. The
    captures were reported from fisheries around the Auckland Islands: two sea lions
    were caught by trawlers targeting squid, and one sea lion was caught on a tow
    targeting scampi. Five sea lion captures were reported by fishers, from vessels
    targeting squid near the Auckland Islands. Two of these animals were among those
    reported by the observers, resulting in a total of six reported sea lion captures
    during the 2008–09 fishing year. From the observed captures, estimates of total
    captures were made for four different strata: trawl effort targeting squid near
    the Auckland Islands, other trawl effort near the Auckland Islands, trawl effort
    targeting southern blue whiting near Campbell Island, and all trawl effort on
    the southern end of the Stewart-Snares shelf. Estimates of sea lion captures were
    calculated for each of these strata, and a single total estimate was calculated
    by combining the output from all strata. The statistical methods used to make
    the estimates followed those used for estimating captures in 2006–07 and 2007–08.

  abstract: 'The fractal properties of specimens of a planar branching sponge Raspailia
    inaequalis (Porifera, Demospongiae) were determined by analysing digitised photographs.
    The specimens, collected from a single site in northeastern New Zealand, had a
    wide range of morphology. Three different fractal methods were used: box counting;
    a method that gives the scaling of branch length with distance from the base of
    the fan; and an allometric analysis of the dependence of frontal area on specimen
    size. All three approaches gave a similar value for the fractal dimension. The
    conjecture hat the specimens have a fractal branching structure is consistent
    with the results of a Horton analysis of their branching pattern. There is a significant
    relationship between fractal dimension and number of fingers, which implies that
    a simple count of the number of fingers is as useful for discriminating between
    individuals as the more complex fractal analysis. Using this relation, sponges
    from a site with less water movement are inferred to have a lower fractal dimension.
    This result is in agreement with the predictions of the Kaandorp model of sponge
    growth.'

  abstract: Active fluorescence (Fast Repetiton Rate Fluorometry, FRRF) was used to
    follow the photosynthetic response of the phytoplankton community during the Southern
    Ocean Iron RElease Experiment (SOIREE). This in situ iron enrichment was conducted
    in the polar waters of the Australasian-Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean in
    February 1999. Iron fertilisation of these High Nitrate Low Chlorophyll (HNLC)
    waters resulted in an increase in the photosynthetic competence (Fv/Fm) of the
    resident cells from around 0.20 to greater than 0.60 (i.e. close to the theoretical
    maximum) by days 10/11 of the experiment. Although a significant iron-mediated
    response in Fv/Fm was detected as early as 24 h after the initial enrichment,
    the increase in Fv/Fm to double ambient levels took 6 days. This response was
    five-fold slower that observed in iron enrichments (in situ and in vitro) in the
    HNLC waters of the sub-polar and Equatorial Pacific. During SOIREE, the photosynthetic
    competence of the resident phytoplankton in iron-enriched waters increased at
    dissolved iron levels above 0.2 nM, suggesting that iron limitation was alleviated
    at this concentration. Increases in Fv/Fm of cells within three algal size classes
    suggested that all taxa displayed a photosynthetic response to iron enrichment.
    Other physiological proxies of algal iron stress (such as flavodoxin expression)
    exhibited different trends than Fv/Fm during the time-course of SOIREE, the relationship
    between Fv/Fm, algal growth rate and such proxies in Southern Ocean waters is
    discussed.

  abstract: Changes in iron supply to oceanic plankton are thought to have a significant
    effect on concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide by altering rates of carbon
    sequestration, a theory known as the iron hypothesis. For this reason, it is important
    to understand the response of pelagic biota to increased iron supply. Here we
    report the results of a mesoscale iron fertilization experiment in the polar Southern
    Ocean, where the potential to sequester iron-elevated algal carbon is probably
    greatest. Increased iron supply led to elevated phytoplankton biomass and rates
    of photosynthesis in surface waters, causing a large drawdown of carbon dioxide
    and macronutrients, and elevated dimethyl sulphide levels after 13 days. This
    drawdown was mostly due to the proliferation of diatom stocks. But downward export
    of biogenic carbon was not increased. Moreover, satellite observations of this
    massive bloom 30 days later, suggest that a sufficient proportion of the added
    iron was retained in surface waters. Our findings demonstrate that iron supply
    controls phytoplankton growth and community composition during summer in these
    polar Southern Ocean waters, but the fate of algal carbon remains unknown and
    depends on the interplay between the processes controlling export, remineralization
    and timescales of water mass subduction.

  abstract: Although the role of habitat fragmentation in species declines is well
    recognised, the effect of habitat quality on species distributions is often studied
    using presence-absence models that ignore metapopulation dynamics. We compared
    three approaches to model the presence-absence of North Island robins in 400 sites
    among 74 fragments of native forest in a 15,000-ha agricultural landscape in New
    Zealand. The first approach only considered local habitat characteristics, the
    second approach only considered metapopulation factors (patch size and isolation),
    and the third approach combined these two types of factors. The distribution of
    North Island robins was best predicted by patch isolation, as their probability
    of occurrence was negatively correlated with isolation from neighbouring patches
    and from the closest major forests, which probably acted as a source of immigrants.
    The inclusion of habitat factors gave only a slight increase in predictive power
    and indicated that robins were more likely to occur in areas with tall canopy,
    tall understory and low density of young trees. We modelled the effect of isolation
    using an index of functional patch connectivity based on dispersal behaviour of
    radio-tracked juveniles, and this functional index greatly improved the models
    in comparison to classical indices relying on Euclidean distances. This study
    highlights the need to incorporate functional indices of isolation in presence-absence
    models in fragmented landscapes, as species occurrence can otherwise be a misleading
    predictor of habitat quality and lead to wrong interpretations and management
    recommendations.

  abstract: Seabirds are attracted to fishing vessels by the discard of wastefrom
    fishing. While this waste provides an available food source, seabirdsforaging
    near vessels are at risk of either being caught or struck by thefishing gear.
    Within New Zealand waters, there were 212 seabirds observedkilled by trawlers
    during the 2006–07 fishing year. Birds feeding on fishingwaste behind trawlers
    may be struck by the trawl warps. The mortality fromwarp-strike can be reduced
    by using mitigation devices, such as tori lines,that deter birds from entering
    the region between the stern and the warps.While tori lines are partially effective,
    numbers of warp interactions arereduced to close to zero if no offal or discards
    are discharged. Strategiesthat reduce the discharge of fishing waste, such as
    converting it to fish mealand retaining it on board, or holding waste and discharging
    it while thevessel is not fishing, are expected to greatly reduce mortality. Many
    vesselshold waste in a container and discard it at intervals, a practice known
    asbatching, in order to reduce interactions with seabirds.In this study it is
    determined whether increasing the interval between batcheddischarges of offal
    reduces the numbers of albatrosses and petrels behind asquid trawl vessel. The
    experiment was carried out on a trawler fishing forarrow squid (Nototodarus sloanii)
    in the Stewart-Snares and Auckland Islandsregions, between February 5 and March
    14, 2008. All fishing waste was held in a4.5 m3 capacity container, and then dumped
    at prescribed intervals. Batcheswere discharged at either 30 minute, 2 hour, 4
    hour or 8 hour intervals.Seabirds were counted in 40m and 10m radius sweep zones
    extending behind thestern of the vessel. Observations were made at 5 minute intervals
    before,during, and after discharge events. Separate counts were made of large
    birds(principally albatross species), small birds (principally petrels) and Capepetrel
    (Daption capense). Cape petrel moved away from the area during the trip,and these
    data are not considered. A statistical model is fitted to the countdata from the
    40m sweep zone, using Bayesian methods.The experiment demonstrates a clear relationship
    between discharge and thenumber of birds close to the stern of the vessel. During
    discharge events,there was an increase in the total numbers of both large birds
    and small birds.There was also an increase in the proportion of birds on the water,
    compared toin the air. The response of the birds to the individual discharge events
    wasrapid, and when discharge ceased the numbers of birds on the water fell back
    tothe level associated with sump water faster than could be resolved by the fiveminute
    observation interval.In each of the different bird groups there were, on average,
    fewer birdspresent during discharge when there was a four or eight hour interval
    betweendischarges, compared to when there was a thirty minute interval. During
    thefour and eight hour treatments, the best estimate was that bird numbers werereduced
    to between 56

  abstract: 'We examined the risk of incidental mortality from commercial fishing
    for 64 seabird species in New Zealand trawl and longline fisheries. For each species,
    the risk was assessed by comparing the total number of birds potentially killed
    while fishing against the Potential Biological Removal (PBR) index. This index
    represents the amount of human-induced mortality a species can sustain without
    compromising its persistence. The PBR was calculated from the best available information
    on the species’ demography. Because estimates of seabirds’ demographic parameters
    and of fisheries related mortality are imprecise, the uncertainty around the demographic
    and mortality estimates was explicitly considered. This allowed uncertainty in
    the resulting risk to be calculated, and also allowed the identification of parameters
    where improved precision would reduce overly large uncertainties. However, not
    all sources of uncertainty could be included, and the results are best used as
    a guide in the setting of research and management priorities. In general, both
    seabird demographic information and the distribution of seabirds within New Zealand
    waters were poorly known. Amongst the 64 studied species, the black petrel (\

    emphProcellaria parkinsoni) clearly stood out as the species the most at risk
    from commercial fishing activities within the New Zealand Exclusive Economic Zone.
    With an average number of potential annual fishing-related fatalities estimated
    to be almost 10 times higher than the PBR, our study suggests that this species
    should become the primary subject of more detailed research and management. Seven
    other species had a number of annual potential fatalities significantly exceeding
    the PBR, as the 95\'

    squid fishery are compared. A simulate and test technique is used,with a trial
    model being used to generate synthetic data that has the samestatistical properties
    as the actual capture data. The estimation approachesare then tried on the simulated
    data. This has the advantages that thesimulated captures are known exactly, and
    that large numbers of simulateddata sets may be produced.The trial model is fitted
    to observer data from the 2000 to 2004 calendaryears. The simulated data are derived
    by applying the trial model to all thetows from the catch effort database that
    were within SQU 6T and which targetedsquid, from the same time period. The trial
    model was a generalised linearmodel (GLM) with fixed effects and with year and
    vessel within year randomeffects. The tested estimation procedures were a fixed
    effects GLM, a GLM withboth fixed and random effects, and a simple ratio estimator.
    The ratio estimateassumes that, within any year, the sea lion strike rate is constant
    across thefishery.In order to reduce sea lion capture, sea lion exclusion devices
    (or SLEDs) wereintroduced into the fishery in 2000. Since 2004 they have been
    used on mosttows. The use of SLEDs has reduced the number of sea lions seen by
    observers,and consequently the estimation problem has become more difficult. Theperformance
    of the estimators is compared under assumed levels of SLEDcoverage, ranging from

  abstract: This report gives a preliminary analysis of data collected to testwhether
    mincing of waste and discards reduces the number of birds attendingfishing trawlers.
    The trial was carried out on a Korean trawler, fishing in thesouthern squid fishery
    during April and March, 2007. The numbers of birds werecounted in 40m and 10m
    semicircular sweep zones extending behind the vessel.Counts were made of five
    different species categories (large albatross, smallalbatross, giant petrel, other
    petrel and shearwater, and cape pigeon). Thebirds were also classified into three
    behavioural categories (flying, sittingon the water, and actively feeding).Three
    different offal treatments were used (discharge without any processing,mincing
    all waste with continuous discharge, and mincing all waste with batcheddischarge).
    During the trip, the fisheries observer who was implementing theexperimental protocol
    made a total of 85 observations. Of these, 35 were madewhen the factory was not
    operating and so when there was no discharge. Theseobservations provide a control,
    but cannot be used for distinguishing betweenthe different treatments. There were
    some problems with the minced and batchedprotocols. Early in the voyage there
    was a high volume of discards which couldnot be batched, as there was insufficient
    room in the factory. The batchedprotocol was then changed to minced. On one tow,
    when the vessel was targetinghoki, the bycatch clogged the mincer and an unprocessed
    treatment wassubstituted. In addition, there were sometimes rocks in the trawl
    and thesecould not be put through the mincer. Small numbers of rocks could be
    removed byhand by the crew, but large numbers meant the minced treatment had to
    bechanged to unprocessed.Despite these problems, the preliminary analysis suggests
    that there was atreatment effect, with fewer large and small albatross attending
    the vesselwhen the discharge was minced. The batched treatment also reduced the
    totalnumbers of large and small albatross within the 40m sweep zone. Thesignificance
    of these results will be checked by statistical modelling.The observer also made
    100 strike observations, 50 of trawl warp strikes and 50of strikes on the tori
    lines. There were no warp strikes observed during thevoyage, and so only the tori
    line strikes are considered. The effect oftreatment on the strikes is unclear.
    There are fewer large bird strikes whenthe discharge is minced, but more small
    bird strikes.

  abstract: Responsible fisheries management requires the consideration of fishing
    effects on ecosystems including non-target species. Extensive distributional overlap
    between fisheries and seabirds, and the attractiveness of the catch and fishery
    waste to foraging birds, leads to fatal interactions between seabirds and fishing
    gear. In a series of experiments, we have investigated measures for managing trawl
    processing waste to reduce seabird mortalities. Different fisheries generate different
    volumes of processing waste, and vessel capacities for holding this waste can
    vary significantly both within and between trawl fleets. Here, we compare seabird
    responses to discharging trawl fisheries waste ad hoc, as and when waste became
    available, with responses to discharging waste after holding periods of 30 min
    and 2 h. Using abundance as a proxy for the risk of mortality, we show that compared
    to discharging ad hoc, holding waste for two specified periods prior to discharge
    significantly reduces vessel attendance by small seabirds, and both small and
    large seabirds, respectively. Drawing on this study and our past work, we provide
    best practice guidelines for trawler waste management to reduce seabird mortality
    due to interactions with trawl warps. If the ideal approach of discharging waste
    only when fishing gear is out of the water is impossible, then discharging waste
    rapidly in maximally large batches, as infrequently as possible is recommended.
    Holding periods of 30 min to 8 h may be required to reduce the abundance of small
    species of seabirds attending vessels. For large seabirds, holding periods of
    2–4 h are required, and 8 h holding periods are still more effective. Discharging
    waste as it becomes available is not recommended. Mincing processing waste can
    reduce the attendance of some seabird species at vessels, especially large albatrosses.
    However, holding waste is preferred, due to relative simplicity in the mechanics
    of dealing with waste, lower cost, and greater reductions in seabird abundance.
    Though developed on trawl fisheries, principles of these guidelines are applicable
    to any fishery discharging waste attractive to seabirds. While holding fisheries
    waste can minimise seabird captures on trawl warps worldwide, evidence-based management
    measures are still required to reduce seabird mortalities in trawl nets.

  abstract: 'Seabird bycatch in trawl fisheries is driven by the attraction of birds
    to foraging opportunities, i.e., the discharge of catch processing waste and the
    contents of trawl nets. The risk of seabird captures increases with seabird abundance
    and exposure to fishing gear. We investigated (1) how quickly seabirds responded
    to discharges of trawl catch processing waste and (2) whether decreasing numbers
    of seabirds attended trawlers during processing waste discharge events as the
    time interval between these events increased. Waste was retained onboard the vessel
    for four different holding periods (30 min, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h), one of which was applied
    each day using a randomised block design. We determined seabird responses to batch
    discharge events after the prescribed holding periods using the abundance of large
    (albatrossses and giant petrels Macronectes spp.) and small (all other petrels
    except cape petrels Daption capense, shearwaters and prions) seabirds in a semi-circle
    of 40 m radius, centred on the stern of the experimental trawler. Seabird responses
    reflected the type of discharge released: birds moved from the air to the water,
    as the amount of food available increased from no discharge, through sump discharge
    to batch discharge. When discharge occurred, seabird abundance increased faster
    than could be resolved with the 5 min sampling period. However, abundance decreased
    more slowly over a 10–15 min period after the discharge event. The number of large
    seabirds attending the vessel during discharge events decreased significantly
    when waste was held for 4 h. For small birds, significant decrease occurred after
    8 h. Such holding periods emphasise the tenacity of foraging seabirds, although
    we have not evaluated any long-term habituation to a particular discharge regime.
    While holding waste for less than 4 h may not reduce seabird attendance during
    discharge events, holding for shorter intervals can still reduce bycatch risk,
    e.g., prior to and during net shooting and hauling.'

  abstract: 'By-catch of seabirds on trawl-fishing gear has been reported worldwide,
    and is exacerbated by the discharge of fisheries waste. We compared the attraction
    of seabirds to three forms of fishery waste – unprocessed discharge (offal, fish
    discards), hashed discharge (smaller chunks passed through a hasher pump) and
    cutter pump discharge (waste passed through the hasher and a cutter pump to further
    reduce particle size) – to identify the discharge form that most effectively reduced
    the risk of seabird by-catch. Seabird responses measured within specified areas
    astern of the vessel were the abundance of: large albatrosses (Diomedea spp.),
    small albatrosses and giant-petrels (Thalassarche spp.; Southern Giant-Petrels,
    Macronectes giganteus; and Northern Giant-Petrels, M. halli), Cape Petrels (Daption
    capense) and all other procellariid species. Seabirds on the water were less numerous
    during cutter pump and hashed discharge relative to unprocessed discharge (except
    small albatrosses – cutter treatment). Also, in some cases, the total number of
    birds decreased, relative to unprocessed discharge treatments (but not small and
    large albatrosses – cutter treatment). Particle size may be less important for
    reducing abundances than temporal discharge patterns, which affected how birds
    tracked the discharge stream. Manipulating discharge characteristics can reduce
    seabird attraction to fishing vessels. However, the risk of by-catch remained
    lowest when no discharging occurred.'

  abstract: 'The risk of seabird bycatch in trawl fisheries is increased byhigh
    numbers of seabirds attending vessels to feed on fish waste discharged.We conducted
    an experimental test of whether mincing fish waste prior to itsdischarge from
    a factory trawler reduced the number of seabirds attending thevessel.The trial
    was conducted on a mid-water trawler targeting hoki (Macruronusnovaezelandiae)
    in New Zealand waters, and the experiment compared threetreatments: 1- discharging
    ’unprocessed’ waste (fish offal and whole discards), 2- mincing all waste to a
    small particle size before discharge, or, 3- converting all waste to fishmeal
    and reducing discharge to sump water.The response to the experimental treatments
    was determined using seabirdabundance within a 40 m-radius semi-circular area
    centred on the vessel stern.Mincing reduced the numbers of large albatrosses (Diomedea
    spp.) feeding asternof the vessel, but had no significant effect on other groups
    of seabirds.In contrast, reducing discharge to sump water resulted in a significantreduction
    in numbers of all groups of seabirds. In particular, the abundance ofthe small
    albatross group (principally Thalassarche spp.), and some smallerprocellarids
    (e.g. sooty shearwater, Puffinus griseus, and white-chinnedpetrel, Procellaria
    aequinoctialis), was reduced to less than five percent ofthe number that were
    within the sweep area when unprocessed discharge wasreleased.While mincing significantly
    reduced the abundance of large albatrosses at thevessel stern, relatively small
    numbers of these birds attend trawl vessels inNew Zealand waters and associated
    bycatch rates are low. In contrast, reducingthe quantity of fish waste discharge
    by mealing resulted in reduced abundancesof a wide range of seabirds at the vessel.
    Therefore, compared to mincing, werecommend fish waste retention as a more effective
    management strategy forreducing seabird bycatch.'

  abstract: In a recent risk assessment, northern royal albatross was identified as
    one the seabird species most atrisk from incidental captures in commercial fisheries
    in New Zealand. The uncertainty of the estimatedrisk was large, owing to its sensitivity
    to the uncertainty surrounding existing estimates of the annualsurvival rate.
    This highlights the need for accurate demographic measures of this species. Demographicrates,
    such as the annual survival rate, are generally difficult to estimate for long-lived
    seabirds such asnorthern royal albatross, because of the length of the study required
    and the remoteness of colonies.Data from a small population of northern royal
    albatross (Diomedea sanfordi) that self-established on themainland of New Zealand
    at Taiaroa Head, provided a unique data set for the estimation of demographicrates.
    Banding as well as monitoring of individuals has been carried out at the Taiaroa
    Head colony since1938. Data on the presence/absence of birds, as well as on breeding
    outcomes, were available for theperiod between 1989–90 and 2011–12, and included
    2128 annual resightings of 355 banded individualsof known-age.The main goal of
    the present study was to estimate the annual survival rate of juveniles, pre-breeders,and
    adults at Taiaroa Head. These rates were estimated simultaneously in a single
    Bayesian multi-statecapture-recapture model. Several models were fitted to the
    data, with different levels of complexity.From the most parsimonious model, the
    overall annual adult survival rate was estimated as 0.95 (95\

  abstract: Many seabird species are experiencing a global decline, with incidental
    mortalities in commercialfisheries considered one of the main causes. While the
    high seabird diversity in New Zealand watershas been widely recognised, the distribution
    of many species remains largely unknown. In addition,current estimates of seabird
    bycatch within New Zealand’s Exclusive Economic Zone lack distributiondata for
    the majority of species, with model estimates based on the assumption that seabird
    distributionsare spatially uniform, at least within large areas. Statistical bycatch
    models could be greatly improved ifobserved captures could be related to the number
    of seabirds present around fishing vessels.Since 2004, government observers have
    recorded the number of seabirds present around commercialfishing vessels in New
    Zealand waters in a relatively consistent framework. These observer data, fromJanuary
    2004 to June 2009, were entered into a database and groomed to correct inconsistencies
    andmistakes made during the data collection. Here, a summary of seabird abundance
    and distribution data arepresented, including comparisons of observer data with
    other data sources. Some preliminary explorationof the data is also presented,
    including its limitations and suggestions to improve the value of datacollected
    in the future.Furthermore, an Internet website was created to make the dataset
    publicly available, includingdistribution maps of seabirds by species or species
    group within New Zealand’s Exclusive EconomicZone.

  abstract: 'This report presents a risk assessment of the effect offishing-related
    mortalities on 70 of the seabird species thatbreed in the New Zealand region.
    The assessment covers allfishing by commercial trawl, bottom-longline, surface-longline,and
    set-net fisheries within New Zealand’s Exclusive EconomicZone. The risk was defined
    as the ratio of the estimated annualnumber of fatalities of birds due to bycatch
    in fisheries to thePotential Biological Removal (PBR), which is an estimate of
    thenumber of seabirds that may be killed without causing thepopulation to decline
    below half the carrying capacity. The riskratio for each seabird species is an
    estimate of the ratiobetween the number of fatalities due to fisheries bycatch,
    andthe PBR.When estimating the PBR for each species, a recovery factor, f ,should
    be specified. This recovery factor is typically between0.1 and 0.5. It allows
    some protection against errors inestimating the PBR, and a lower value allows
    for a shorterrecovery time for depleted populations. In this report, the riskratio
    is calculated using PBR1: the value of the PBR calculatedwith f = 1. The values
    of the recovery factor for each specieswill be specified at a later stage. When
    interpreting the riskratio, it should be borne in mind that species with risk
    ratiosless than one may still be considered at risk, depending on thevalue of
    the recovery factor.Estimation of annual fatalities was based on seabird capturesreported
    by observers between the 2006–07 and 2010–11 fishingyears. From these captures,
    the total observable captures wereestimated (the number of seabird captures that
    would have beenreported had an observer been on every fishing vessel). Not allseabirds
    that are killed are brought on-board vessels, and theobservable captures were
    multiplied by a factor to account forthese cryptic mortalities. The cryptic multiplier
    varied between1.30 and 8.66, depending on fishing method and seabird species.This
    study replaces a previous seabird risk assessment that useda similar methodology.
    Demographic parameters and distributionswere updated for some species, the methods
    used for estimatingobservable captures were changed, and calculation of the PBR
    wasmodified to include an additional calibration factor. Because ofthe number
    of methodological changes that were made, changes inrisk between the two assessments
    should not be taken as being dueto changes in the fisheries.In total, there were

    of the population size (Nmin), as PBR = rmax Nmin f, where f (typically between
    0.1 and 0.5) is a“recovery factor” that may be set lower to allow a populationto
    recover faster, or to provide additional protection to thepopulation. If the human-caused
    mortalities are less than thePBR, then a depleted population will be able to recover
    so that,given sufficient time, it has a 95
