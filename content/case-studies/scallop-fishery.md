# Coromandel scallop fishery

We created an effective reporting system to monitor catch and effort in the
Coromandel scallop fishery for the New Zealand Seafood Industry Council and the
Coromandel Scallop Fishermen's Association.

## About the fishery

The Coromandel scallop fishery is a seasonal fishery covering the area from
Tauranga in the Bay of Plenty to Rodney, north of Auckland. The number of
participants in the commercial fishery is relatively small, with the total
catch harvested by seven local vessels.

The Seafood Industry Council responded to a need identified by the scallop
fishers to better align the operation and management of their fishery, and
where appropriate, use historical information from the fishery in place of
expensive external surveys. Data collection needed to be at an appropriate
spatial scale, and on an ongoing basis, to monitor the abundance and condition
of scallops in the various scallop beds.

Detailed records of fishing effort and catch were required to allow the fleet
to implement a strategy of fishing individual beds only when catch rates and
scallop condition exceeded pre-defined thresholds. Such in-season
decision-making would support the efficient and sustainable use of the resource
as well as building information about the fishery. Statutory reporting to the
Ministry of Fisheries is at a larger spatial scale and did not readily support
this new management approach.

As the fishers already work closely together they saw this as an extension to
the information that is already shared between them, and were supportive of the
move.

## Database design and implementation

The Seafood Industry Council approached Dragonfly Science to set up a robust
data collection and management system for the fishery. The result is an online
system with numerical and graphical output generated weekly from data collected
by each vessel on every fishing day.

"We wanted to make the information readily available to those involved, so they
could see how things were going at a glance. They can now easily see what the
catch rate is, and how close they are to the limits", says Finlay Thompson.

Forms are partially filled in on the boat and completed at the factory after
processing. Then they are scanned and emailed to different people for data
entry via a web interface. A unique identifying number is provided for each
form to ensure validation is possible and all the data can be tracked. The
forms include details of the catch, recovery rate, weather, sea conditions and
tow position.

"We sat down and entered a lot of data from the forms ourselves, as part of the
design process. Even the most careful data-entry people will make mistakes, so
we set up a system for reconciling copies of the data entered by different
people. As a simple visual check, cells with discrepancies are coloured red.
These can be corrected by comparison with the original scanned paper version,
which is also in the database.

"For our client, it was really important to get reliable data, so they could
implement their preferred management approach and demonstrate to the Ministry
that the data they were providing was robust. The checking processes we put in
place have met this need.

Finlay continues, "Given the effort you expend to collect data, having some
good data management around it afterwards does not seem unreasonable."

> "It was a pain-free process for us. Dragonfly very quickly provided the data
> entry, data collection and data analysis required. They understood our needs
> and set up a great model for us. We now have an easy to use interface for data
> entry as well as a weekly report that conveys all the information required in a
> colourful and succinct way. Dragonfly was also able to modify the reports in
> season based on feedback from the fishers on data presentation.

> "Dragonfly use technology innovatively but not excessively. They recognised
> that our reporting needs will change and grow over time, so they put in a
> simple system that didn't require a big investment up front, but can easily be
> added to in the future."
