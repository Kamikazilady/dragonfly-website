## [New Zealand Regional Economic Activity](http://www.mbie.govt.nz/what-we-do/business-growth-agenda/regions)

June 6 • 2014

Dragonfly has created an [interactive web visualisation](http://www.mbie.govt.nz/what-we-do/business-growth-agenda/regions/interactive-web-tool)
presenting information on population, employment, GDP and annual household income across
the country's 66 territorial authorities for the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment ([MBIE](http://www.mbie.govt.nz/)).
The source data used for the visualisation are derived from Statistics New Zealand and MBIE data,
and are available as CSV files [from the MBIE website](http://www.mbie.govt.nz/what-we-do/business-growth-agenda/regions).
The datasets include regional GDP by industry, household income, employment by industry,
tourism origins and products, and population.

## [Protected species captures in New Zealand fisheries](http://data.dragonfly.co.nz/psc/)

February 27 • 2013

Seabirds, marine mammals, and turtles are caught during commercial fishing operations.
In order to monitor the impacts of fishing on these species, government observers on fishing vessels
record any protected species bycatch incidents that occur.
Observer data on protected species captures are maintained by the Ministry for Primary
Industries, with identification of captured animals carried out by the Department of Conservation.
Data on protected species captures in trawl and longline fisheries, from the 2002–03 fishing
year onwards, are made available [here](http://data.dragonfly.co.nz/psc/).

## [Seabird counts around fishing-vessels](http://data.dragonfly.co.nz/seabird-counts/)

November 19 • 2013

New Zealand is a global centre of seabird diversity, with over 80 species breeding either on the mainland or on offshore
islands. New Zealand fisheries observers record the number of seabirds around fishing vessels. These observer data give a
unique record of the distribution of seabirds in the New Zealand region.
The seabird count data may be accessed [here](http://data.dragonfly.co.nz/seabird-counts/).

As part of monitoring of the New Zealand sea lion population carried out by the Department of Conservation, New Zealand sea
lions in the sub-antarctic have been tagging and resighted. This is the dataset of New Zealand sealion tagging data, used for
studies of sea lion demographics.
