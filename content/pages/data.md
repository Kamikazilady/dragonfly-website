# Data

At Dragonfly Science we support making research data available for reuse.
This aligns with the New Zealand government goal to release data under open access licenses
[NZGOAL](http://ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/information-and-data/nzgoal/).

This page summarises the data sets that we have made available, through our work on interactions
between protected species and fisheries.
We have experience building custom web applications for exploring data and releasing it into the
open, please email [edward@dragonfly.co.nz](mailto:edward@dragonfly.co.nz) if you have data that you would like to set free.


## [New Zealand Regional Economic Activity](http://www.mbie.govt.nz/what-we-do/business-growth-agenda/regions)

June 6 • 2014

Dragonfly has created an [interactive web visualisation](http://www.mbie.govt.nz/what-we-do/business-growth-agenda/regions/interactive-web-tool)
presenting information on population, employment, GDP and annual household income across
the country's 66 territorial authorities for the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment ([MBIE](http://www.mbie.govt.nz/)).
The source data used for the visualisation are derived from Statistics New Zealand and MBIE data,
and are available as CSV files [from the MBIE website](http://www.mbie.govt.nz/what-we-do/business-growth-agenda/regions).
The datasets include regional GDP by industry, household income, employment by industry,
tourism origins and products, and population.

## [Protected species captures in New Zealand fisheries](http://data.dragonfly.co.nz/psc/)

February 27 • 2013

Seabirds, marine mammals, and turtles are caught during commercial fishing operations.
In order to monitor the impacts of fishing on these species, government observers on fishing vessels
record any protected species bycatch incidents that occur.
Observer data on protected species captures are maintained by the Ministry for Primary
Industries, with identification of captured animals carried out by the Department of Conservation.
Data on protected species captures in trawl and longline fisheries, from the 2002–03 fishing
year onwards, are made available [here](http://data.dragonfly.co.nz/psc/).
