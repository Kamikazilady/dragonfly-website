# People

As data scientists, we use statistics and programming to put information into action. We’re attracted to questions that can help to answer big-picture problems and use our technical skills and creativity to find novel solutions. 

We believe that being open with information creates collaboration, drives discussion, and encourages innovation. We’re committed to open source, open data and open science wherever possible. 

Clients come to us because their problems are complex and multifaceted. As an independent organisation, we shift discussions by bringing solid, reliable evidence to the conversation and let objectivity take the heat out of discussions.

Every project gives us the potential to grow our expertise, open opportunities and establish our reputation for excellence. Give us the opportunity to do good in the world across a dynamic sector with massive influence.

We want to work with clients who drive innovation.
